## **Project Overview**

AtliQ Grands, a fictitious chain of five-star luxury/business hotels across India, has been facing challenges in maintaining market share and revenue due to competitors' strategic moves and ineffective internal management. To address these issues, the company's revenue management team has initiated a data-driven approach to support business intelligence and regain competitive advantage. This project involves working with a third-party analytics provider to generate insights from historical data and guide AtliQ Grands in making informed strategic decisions.

This repository serves as a roadmap and documentation for the insights required to help AtliQ Grands optimize their operations, improve revenue, and regain market share.

## **Recommendations**

### **1. Revenue Optimization and Dynamic Pricing**
- Implement dynamic pricing models to optimize room rates in real-time, based on demand fluctuations and competitor rates.
- Leverage Hyderabad's high customer satisfaction to create loyalty programs for returning customers.
- Consider increasing the room supply in high-demand areas.
- Increase per-booking revenue by offering premium services such as room upgrades, spas, or other amenities.
- Continue investing in customer experience to ensure these high ratings are maintained. Happy customers often lead to repeat bookings and positive reviews.

### **2. Reducing Cancellations**
- Focus on platforms with high cancellation rates and implement customer retention strategies (e.g., flexible policies, and targeted offers).
- Introduce more flexible cancellation policies with partial refunds or rebooking incentives to reduce cancellations.
- Utilize predictive analytics to identify customers most likely to cancel, allowing proactive engagement to reduce cancellations.

### **3. Increasing Direct Bookings**
- Since direct online and offline bookings represent a small portion (15%), invest in marketing campaigns that promote direct bookings and offer exclusive benefits for customers booking through AtliQ Grands’ website.
- Improve the digital experience on the website and mobile platform to increase conversion rates.

### **4. Boosting Weekend Occupancy**
- Target leisure travellers with customized weekend packages and promotions that enhance the guest experience.
- Introduce weekend-specific promotions to increase weekend stays, such as discounted rates, themed weekend getaways, or family packages.
- Strengthen partnerships with local businesses and corporations to secure more weekday bookings through business conferences or corporate travel deals.
  
### **5. Property-Specific Insights**
- Identify underperforming properties and address operational inefficiencies that affect guest satisfaction and revenue.
- Invest in high-performing properties with potential for expansion and growth, replicating successful models like AtliQ Exotica.
- Add more properties or increase hotel capacity in Delhi to meet potential demand.

## **Conclusion & Next Steps**:

The Atliq Grands hotels are performing strongly across Mumbai and Bangalore, with opportunities for growth in Delhi and Hyderabad.
